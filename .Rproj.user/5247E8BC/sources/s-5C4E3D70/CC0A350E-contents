# 616-Project
 
 This Beach Tan Analysis can be found on the RMD document and HTML document in the github that you opened this readme document from. They are both described as Reproducible Analysis. I have detailed the steps to take to reproduce this analysis in both of those files.
 
 
 To reproduce this analysis, you must first download the BeachTan CSV file from the github and add it to your working directory so that it can be opened in R to reproduce this analysis. 
 
 If you would like to look at the original data before I cleaned it, the data dictionary is in the excel file called Beach Tan Data and Description in the github.
