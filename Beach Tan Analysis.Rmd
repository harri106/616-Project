### Software Environment 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```


### Packages Used 

I used the DataExplorer package to plot the amount of missingness in each variable.
I used the tidyverse, backports, and dplyr packages to recode variable levels. 
I used checkpoint so this version of R can be accessed with the correct packages when this analysis is reproduced in the futurre.

```{r}
if(require(checkpoint)==FALSE)
  install.packages("checkpoint")
checkpoint(snapshotDate = "2020-10-01")
if(require(pacman)==FALSE)
  install.packages("pacman")
p_load(DataExplorer, dplyr, tidyverse, backports)
```


# Overview of the Purpose of Analysis

  Beach Tan is a popular indoor tanning salon that has several locations across the US. While Beach Tan is a very popular indoor tanning destination, Beach Tan struggles with getting their clients to purchase retail. A lot of clients purchase their retail online rather than in store. Due to this, Beach Tan's marketing team was tasked with creating more targted promotions for retail to increase retail revenue at Beach Tan locations. Currrently, the marketing team's promotions are broad and the same for every client. The marketing team wants to know what type of clients are purchasing retail and what type of clients are not so they can better target certain clients with retail ads.
  
  In this analysis, I attempt to gain a deeper insight into the tanning habits of Beach Tan customers by examining how a client's age, gender, membership type, membership level, amount of sunless tans, and amount of UV tans affect Beach Tan's retail revenue. To do so, I created a multiple linear regression model on the Beach Tan data that was pulled from BeachTan dataset. It is important to note that this data was preprocessed by Dr.Jones-Farmer. The csv for the BeachTan data and the excel file with the data dictionary are included in the github 616-Project. 

# Description of Beach Tan Data

The Beach Tan data set has 11,041 observations which were compiled from ten different Beach Tan store locations in 2014.

The variables are as follows:

* **UIDClient**: Client Identification Number
- **UIDStoreLocation**: Store Identification Number 
+ **Gender**: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
* **DateJoined**: Date the client became a member of Beach Tan. If the client is a non-member, this is the date and time of their first tanning session. 
* **DaysSinceJoined**: The number of days elapsed between DateJoined and 11/1/2014. 
* **MembershipType**: 0 = Non Membership, 1 = Monthly Membership, 2 = Annual Membership
* **MembershipLevel**: Types of levels are based on the level of tanning equiptment. The higher the membership level, the higher the tanning equiptment level availiable to the client. Higher tanning equiptment results in faster tanning results. 0 = Non Membership, 2 = Faster, 3 = Fastest, 4 = Instant
* **Age**: Age of client in years
* **UVTans**: The number of Ultra Violet Tans a client has taken since they joined Beach Tan. UV tans include tans in UV beds or tans in stand-up booths.
* **SunlessTans**: The number of sunless tans a client has taken since they joined Beach Tan. Sunless tans are spray tans.
* **UpgradeRevenue**: Amount spent in dollars by members to tan in a higher level bed than what their regular membership includes.
* **RetailRevenue**: Amount spent in dollars on various skin care lotions and products that Beach Tan offers.

Here is a glimpse of the data to get a better look. Several variable's data types are incorrect. I will discuss which ones I need to change in the preprocessing section of this analysis.
```{r}
BeachTan<-read.csv("BeachTan.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(BeachTan)
tail(BeachTan)
```


### Checking for Missing Variables 

A very small percentage of DateJoined was missing so I used na.omit to remove these missing observations. The variable gender does include some NULL values. I assume that clients either forgot to fill in this question, refused to disclose what gender they identify as, or do not identify as a female or male.


```{r}
plot_missing(BeachTan)
```

```{r}
BeachTan <- na.omit(BeachTan)
plot_missing(BeachTan)
```


# Details On Data Preprocessing 

### Converting Variables to the Correct Data Types


Several variables have incorrect datatypes which need to be fixed. I looked at the data types to better examine which variables have incorrect datatypes.
```{r}
str(BeachTan)
```



Currently, MembershipType is an integer but it needs to be changed to a factor because it has categorical levels.
```{r}
BeachTan$MembershipType<-as.factor(BeachTan$MembershipType)
```

MembershipLevel is currently an integer but needs to be changed to a factor because it has categorical levels.

```{r}
BeachTan$MembershipLevel<-as.factor(BeachTan$MembershipLevel)
```

DateJoined is currently a factor but should be a date. 
```{r}
BeachTan$DateJoined<- as.character(BeachTan$DateJoined)
BeachTan$DateJoined <- as.Date(BeachTan$DateJoined, "%m/%d/%Y")
```

### Creating the correct amount of levels for variables that are factors

Gender currently has 4 levels which are "", #NULL!, 0, and 1. I combined "" and #NULL! to one level called missing. I ran a multiple linear regression with gender including a level of missing and the missing level made the gender an insignificant predictor so I decided to drop the missing values as there were only 20 of them. 
```{r}
BeachTan$Gender=fct_recode(BeachTan$Gender,missing="",missing="#NULL!")
BeachTan=BeachTan[-which(BeachTan$Gender=="missing"),]
BeachTan$Gender=fct_drop(BeachTan$Gender,only="missing")
table(BeachTan$Gender)
```


### Checking for Outliers

I graphed the quantitative and qualitative variables to look for any unusual observations or extreme outliers because if any of these are present they will throw off the regression. There seems to be no extreme outliers or unusual observations. 

```{r}
plot_histogram(BeachTan)
```


```{r}
plot_bar(BeachTan)
```

### Checking for Correlation Between Predictor Variables 

I checked the correlation between predictor variables to make sure that no two variables are too highly correlated. No variables are too highly correlated. 

```{r}
plot_correlation(BeachTan)
```

# Final Analysis 


## Buidling a Multiple Linear Regression Model

I set a random seed so this regression can be produced again. Age was not found to be a significant predictor in the first regression I ran, so I excluded it from the following regression. 

```{r}
options(scipen=999)
set.seed(13)
RetailRegression <- lm(RetailRevenue ~  Gender + MembershipType + MembershipLevel + UVTans + SunlessTans, data = BeachTan)
summary(RetailRegression)
```


## Results from Multiple Linear Regression Model

Gender, MembershipType, MembershipLevel, UVTans, and SunlessTans all are significant predictors for retail revenue. Age is not a significant predictor for retail revenue. The average error in this prediction model is 77.25. This model accounts for about 34% of the variation in retail revenue. The average explained variation using these predictors is about 640 times more than the unexplained variation. From this model I can conclude that at least one predictor is a good predictor of retail revenue, since the p-value is so low.

It is important to note that the purpose of this model was to examine which predictor variables are significant predictors in predicting retail revenue. The RMSE is high and the multiple R-squared is low because at least one of the levels in MembershipType and MembershipLevel were found to not be significant. However, I kept these two variables in the model because at least one of their levels were found to be significant predictors.

**MembershipType Interpertation**

Clients whose membership type is annual (MembershipType2) are most likely to purchase retail in the presence of the other predictor variables. Clients who are not members (MembershipType0) are least likely to purchase retail in the presence of the other predictors.

**MembershipLevel Interpertation**

Clients whose membership level are 3 and 4 are the most likely to purchase retail. Clients in Membership level 1 are the least likely to purchase retail.

**UVTans Interperation**

As the amount of times a client UVTans increases by 1, retail revenue increases by 1.16492 in the presence of the other variables. So the more times a client UVTans, the more likely they are to purchase retail. 

**SunlessTans Interperation**

As the amount of times a client SunlessTans increases by 1, retail revenue increases by 1.03375 in the presence of the other variables. So the more times a client sunless tans, the more likely they are to purchase retail. 


# Conclusion 

This regression model displays which types of clients are least likely to purchcase retail, so the marketing team can target these clients in hopes of getting them to purchase more retail. I would recommened that the marketing target clients who are in MembershipLevel1 with promotions because they are the least likely to purchase retail. I would also recommened to the marketing team that they target clients who are not members and clients who are in membership level 1 because these two groups are far less likely to purchase retail than those clients who are in membership level 2. The marketing team could also target clients who are newer to Beach Tan because the less amount of UVTans and SunlessTans a client has done, the less likely they are to purchase retail. Lastly, I would suggest the marketing team target Males with promotions for retail since males are far less likely than females to purchase retail. Retail tends to be more tailored towards women since women are more likely to tan. If the marketing team could find a way to make more males consider purchasing retail, I believe this would contribute positively to retail revenue. 

Overall, this regression model has allowed the marketing team to gain a better understanding of different client's tanning habits and what type of clients are purchasing retail. This information will aid the marketing team in creating more customized promotions. These targeted promotions should lead to an increase in retail revenue. 

Additionally, this model can be used again in the future when new data is acquired. Based on what type of clients the marketing team promotes to, this model can be used to see if certain types of client's have had an increase in retail revenue, which will be a nice way to see if their ads are working the way the want them to.
